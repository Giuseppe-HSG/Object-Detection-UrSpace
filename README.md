# Object-Detection-UrSpace

We trained our custom detection model which is able to identify the various classes of objects within images from the Homestyler website. Theoretically, the pre-built configurations from UrSpace or the ones pesonalised on the website would be sent to the object- detection model which is able to identify the type of furniture that the AMR should move. In addition, the bounding boxes could be scaled to represent the true dimensions of the room in order for the robot to know where the identified furniture should be moved within the room.
